# FastestPath
Finds the shortest path between two points given obstacles. Used to practice recursion. 


The input is a grid that determines where the starting and final destinations are. Additionally, there are two kinds of obstacles, "I" (for ice) and "C" (for castle), that the turtle can run into--note that the turtle is the chaaracter doing the travelling. Ice can be broken but it takes one move to break while castles cannot be broken. The program finds the smalles number of moves necessary to reach the final destination, which is labeled as "D" (for diamond).
